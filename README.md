# bayesian_collection_stratintervals

Code for the paper on Bayesian stratintervals (Ballen, 2025).

## Structure of this repository

The following directories contain the code for replicating the results in the paper.

- `bayesian_inference_largenumbers`: This directory contains 1000 simulations for testing the Bayesian model.
- `example2_barracudas`: Here we have both code and data for the example on the origination age of the Barracudas.
- `lambda_on_thetas`: The simulations on the effect of different values of $\lambda$ on $\theta_1,\theta_2$
- `single_posteriors`: The posterior sampling from specific posteriors of a fixed, increasing sample size.
- `example1_cerrejon`: Example using the Palynomorphs of the Cerrej√≥n formation for showing inference of stratigraphic intervals as well as conflation
- `likelihood_surfaces`: The plots showing the undesirable behaviour of maximum likelihood estimation.
